# Kickstart My Chart

Analysis Completed by Michelle Risucci

# Background:

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. 

# Objective:

Discover if the outcome of a specific Kickstarter project can be predicted through exploring relationships between project category and subcategory, the launch date, and the size of the initial goal from 4,000 past Kickstarter projects.

# Data/Method:

The following steps were taken to better observe the relationships between category, initial goal, and timeline:

•	Created Percent Funded column to uncover how much money the campaign made to reach its initial goal.

•	Added Average Donation column see the average each backer paid.

•	Created two additional columns – Category and Sub-Category to see the relationship between the outcome and type of projects.

•	Converted the date stamps to Excel time format to compare outcomes with time of year.

•	Created an additional dataset reviewing the outcome of a project compared with amount of the initial goal.
